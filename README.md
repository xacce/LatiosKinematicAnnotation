# LatiosKinematicAnnotation

You need to annotate bones and then work with them in some way
Add LatiosEditorBones to the animated object. It will save the positions as well as the paths.
Click Save paths to SO, it will save them to Assets/*. Now you have paths to the bones in SO.

Use Latios/Ext/LatiosPathAnnotationSo to create an annotation
LatiosPathsAnnotations - to associate annotations with paths

The package does not contain anything that will go into the build. All this is required to work with bones in the editor
